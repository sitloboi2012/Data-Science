<p><strong><i>Welcome to SitLoBoi Project.</i></strong></p> 
<p><strong><i>This is where I upload different type of Folder that is I did during my high school and university year</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>The explaination for each of the Folder is at below. This would help you have a clearer view what is happening in each of the Folder</i></strong></p>
</br>

# Algorithm Hacker Rank & Code Force Folder
<p><strong><i>Algorithm + Competition</i></strong></p>
<p>This is where I joined into multiple of competition on Hacker Rank and Codeforce platform</br>
I practice and update my algorithm skill through out each of the problem that I did during the competition and training</p>
<p>Also, this is where I learnt multiple of Algorithm Technique like Sort, Stack, Big O Notation, etc.</p>

# Portfolio
<p><strong><i>Personal + Internship Project</i></strong></p>
<p>This is where I end up learning and applying Data Science knowleadge into real-life dataset</br>
Not only that, for each of the Project, it represent the knowleadge of Data Science that I have gain during that period </br>
I will arrange from the latest to the oldest project that I have done </br>
And there will be a background story behind every folder in Portfolio </p>

# Python GUI
<p><strong><i>Specific Python Project</i></strong></p>
<p>In this folder, I usually upload the project that not related to Data Science or Algorithm </br>
This is implement Python GUI Project such as Music Player or Chat Room Server</p>
